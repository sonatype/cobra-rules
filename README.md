# cobra-rules

A set of rules for the Cobra tool

Existing set of rules in Lift repository, `deployment/service/muse-analyst/cobra/`

Lift integration script is in Lift repo `deployment/service/muse-analyst/cobra.sh`

TODO: Rewrite existing set of rules to use .cobra and .def, modify cobra.sh to use -json with the new ruleset.
